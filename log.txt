Okay, that was quite an unproductive moment.
Basically, the problem was that I couldn't
quite figure out how to import types and
functions from funfix module. It's
two problem at once that I'm not sure
which is which.

Strangely enough, I don't need to import
the functions and classes from funfix.
Just npeminstalling them makes them
available in the global namespace. I'm
probably doing something wrong since
it's polluting the global namespace. But
hey, it's what I get from avoiding the
webpack tooling, since I can't
use "import * as blah from 'blah'".

As for the types, I don't need to
import anything, I just dumped
them on the global namespace. Again,
I'm probably doing something wrong, but
it doesn't really matter since I just
wanted the Either type for a typesafe
error handling.
